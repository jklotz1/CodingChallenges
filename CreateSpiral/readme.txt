Challenge2 - createSpiral(N)
python 3.4.2 was used

The createSpiral(N) function is located within CreateSpiral.py which uses the Spiral class (defined in Spiral.py) and Direction class and subclasses (defined in Direction.py)

Each .py file was tested, test cases can be found in the corresponding Test.py file, the output of each of these files was written to a TestOutput.txt file.
Note: print lines in CreateSprial.py were commented out for testing to avoid unnecessary output during testing

The createSpiral(N) function was run on a variety of inputs found in CreateSpiralInput.py, the output was written to CreateSpiralOutput.txt
